### Random form -> fixed number of circles or random number?

# Cris

Formulas for:
### Circle [X]
- need to know center point and radius of circle
- distance formula between A(xa, ya) and B(xb, yb):
AB = sqrt( (xa - xb)^2 + (ya - yb)^2 )
- if distance smaller or equal to radius => point is in circle, otherwise it is outside of circle

### Vertical lines [X]
- lines have a width of k pixels
- they start at multiple of n pixels
Note: must decide k and n (n > k)
- point A(xa, ya) is on line if xa % n < k 

### Horizontal lines [X]
- lines have a width of k pixels
- they start at multiple of n pixels
Note: must decide k and n (n > k)
- point A(xa, ya) is on line if ya % n < k

### Square [X]
- must know top left corner coordinates A(xl, yu) and bottom right corner coordinates B(xr, yd)
- point P(x, y) is in square if:
(x >= xl && x <= xr) && (y >= yu && y <= yd)

### Optional random form [ ]


# Q&A
### Debouncing [ ]
### 6 7 8 ports [ ]
### all other ports [ ]
### Hsync/Vsync [ ]
### Documentation [ ]
### Change image switch/buttons [ ]
### Do we change colors in an image or can we just make every form different color [ ]
